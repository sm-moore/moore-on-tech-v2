### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup peanut butter (melted in microwave)
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 Tbsp coconut oil (unrefined)
- Unsweetened shredded coconut (optional for the top)
- Cupcake liners (I used silicone ones)

### Directions

1. Melt the chocolate. In a glass dish put your vegan chocolate chips and half of the coconut oil. Place in the microwave for 15 seconds at a time and stir between until the chocolate is completely melted.
2. Prepare the peanut butter. Melt the peanut butter in the microwave for 15-20 seconds until its warm and runny. Add the remaining coconut oil and powdered sugar. Stir to combine. 
3. Put the peanut butter in the bottom of your cupcake liners and pour the chocolate on top. Sprinkle with shredded coconut and freeze for 30 minutes to an hour.
4. Enjoy! I cut mine into fourths for easier nibbling.
