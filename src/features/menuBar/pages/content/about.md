### Why "i drink my tea black"?
First off, when I say black tea, I really just mean tea with nothing added. Just plain tea. I love all teas but usually go for a simple green, indian chai, or english breakfast. 

A few years ago I started a journey to be more eco-conscious and better to my body. I have many fond memories of mornings spent drinking fair-trade (when I can find it) black tea, planning my day, pondering life, and sometimes it's just what I need to convince myself to get out of bed. Not to mention, plain black tea is the perfect hangover cure. 

To me, tea is medicine for the body, and the mind and it marks the start of a new day and a fresh start.
